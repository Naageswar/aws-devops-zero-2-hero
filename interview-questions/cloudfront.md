### 1. What is Amazon CloudFront?
Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service provided by AWS that accelerates content delivery by distributing it across a network of edge locations.

### 2. How does CloudFront work?
CloudFront caches content in edge locations globally. When a user requests content, CloudFront delivers it from the nearest edge location, reducing latency and improving performance.

### 3. What are edge locations in CloudFront?
Edge locations are data centers globally distributed by CloudFront. They store cached content and serve it to users, minimizing the distance data needs to travel.

### 4. What types of distributions are available in CloudFront?
CloudFront offers Web Distributions for websites and RTMP Distributions for media streaming.

### 5. How can you ensure that content in CloudFront is updated?
You can create invalidations in CloudFront to remove cached content and force the distribution of fresh content.

### 6. Can you use custom SSL certificates with CloudFront?
Yes, you can use custom SSL certificates to secure connections between users and CloudFront.

### 7. What is an origin in CloudFront?
An origin is the source of the content CloudFront delivers. It can be an Amazon S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, an Elastic Load Balancer, or even an HTTP server.

### 8. How can you control who accesses content in CloudFront?
You can use CloudFront signed URLs or cookies to restrict access to content based on user credentials.

### 9. What are cache behaviors in CloudFront?
Cache behaviors define how CloudFront handles different types of requests. They include settings like TTL, query string forwarding, and more.

### 10. How can you integrate CloudFront with other AWS services?
You can integrate CloudFront with Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and more to accelerate content delivery.

### 11. How can you analyze CloudFront distribution performance?
You can use CloudFront access logs stored in Amazon S3 to analyze the performance of your distribution.

### 12. What is the purpose of CloudFront behaviors?
CloudFront behaviors help specify how CloudFront should respond to different types of requests for different paths or patterns.

### 13. Can CloudFront be used for dynamic content?
Yes, CloudFront can be used for both static and dynamic content delivery, improving the performance of web applications.

### 14. What is a distribution in CloudFront?
A distribution represents the configuration and content for your CloudFront content delivery. It can have multiple origins and cache behaviors.

### 15. How does CloudFront handle cache expiration?
CloudFront uses Time to Live (TTL) settings to determine how long objects are cached in edge locations before checking for updates.

### 16. What are the benefits of using CloudFront with Amazon S3?
Using CloudFront with Amazon S3 reduces latency, offloads traffic from your origin server, and improves global content delivery.

### 17. Can CloudFront be used for both HTTP and HTTPS content?
Yes, CloudFront supports both HTTP and HTTPS content delivery. HTTPS is recommended for enhanced security.

### 18. How can you measure the performance of CloudFront distributions?
You can use CloudFront metrics in Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the performance of your distributions and analyze their behavior.

### 19. What is origin shield in CloudFront?
Origin Shield is an additional caching layer that helps reduce the load on your origin server by caching content closer to the origin.

### 20. How can CloudFront improve security?
CloudFront can help protect against DDoS attacks by absorbing traffic spikes and providing secure connections through HTTPS.
