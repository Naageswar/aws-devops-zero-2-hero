### 1. What is AWS CodeBuild?
AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software artifacts, such as executable files or application packages.

### 2. How does CodeBuild work?
CodeBuild uses build specifications defined in buildspec.yml files. When triggered by a source code change, it pulls the code from the repository, follows the build steps specified, and generates the build artifacts.

### 3. What is a buildspec.yml file?
A buildspec.yml file is used to define the build steps, environment settings, and other instructions for CodeBuild. It's stored in the same repository as the source code and provides the necessary information to execute the build.

### 4. How can you integrate CodeBuild with CodePipeline?
You can add a CodeBuild action to your CodePipeline stages. This enables you to use CodeBuild as one of the actions in your CI/CD workflow for building and testing code.

### 5. What programming languages and build environments does CodeBuild support?
CodeBuild supports a wide range of programming languages and build environments, including Java, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Go, .NET, Docker, and more.

### 6. Explain the caching feature in CodeBuild.
The caching feature allows you to store certain directories in Amazon S3 to speed up build times. CodeBuild can fetch cached content instead of rebuilding dependencies, improving overall build performance.

### 7. How does CodeBuild handle environment setup and cleanup?
CodeBuild automatically provisions and manages the build environment based on the specifications in the buildspec.yml file. After the build completes, CodeBuild automatically cleans up the environment.

### 8. Can you customize the build environment in CodeBuild?
Yes, you can customize the build environment by specifying the base image, build tools, environment variables, and more in the buildspec.yml file.

### 9. What are artifacts and how are they used in CodeBuild?
Artifacts are the output files generated by the build process. They can be binaries, archives, or any other build output. These artifacts can be stored in Amazon S3 or other destinations for later use.

### 10. How can you secure sensitive information in your build process?
Sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, should be stored in AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. You can retrieve these secrets securely during the build process.

### 11. Describe a scenario where you'd use multiple build environments in a CodeBuild project.
You might use multiple build environments to support different stages of the development process. For example, you could have one environment for development builds and another for production releases.

### 12. What is the role of build projects in CodeBuild?
A build project defines how CodeBuild should build your source code. It includes settings like the source repository, build environment, buildspec.yml location, and other configuration details.

### 13. How can you troubleshoot a failing build in CodeBuild?
You can view build logs and examine the output of build steps to identify issues. If a buildspec.yml file has errors, they can often be resolved by reviewing the syntax and ensuring proper settings.

### 14. What's the benefit of using CodeBuild over traditional build tools?
CodeBuild is fully managed and scalable. It eliminates the need to provision and manage build servers, making it easier to set up and scale build processes without infrastructure overhead.

### 15. Can you build Docker images using CodeBuild?
Yes, CodeBuild supports building Docker images as part of the build process. You can define build steps to build and push Docker images to repositories like Amazon ECR.

### 16. How can you integrate third-party build tools with CodeBuild?
You can define build steps in your buildspec.yml file to execute third-party build tools or scripts. This enables seamless integration with tools specific to your project's needs.

### 17. What happens if a build fails in CodeBuild?
If a build fails, CodeBuild can be configured to stop the pipeline in CodePipeline, send notifications, and provide detailed logs to help diagnose and resolve the issue.

### 18. Can you set up multiple build projects within a single CodeBuild project?
Yes, a CodeBuild project can have multiple build projects associated with it. This is useful when you want to build different components of your application in parallel.

### 19. How can you monitor and visualize build performance in CodeBuild?
You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and visualize metrics from CodeBuild, such as build duration, success rates, and resource utilization.

### 20. Explain how CodeBuild pricing works.
CodeBuild pricing is based on the number of build minutes consumed. A build minute is billed per minute of code build time, including time spent provisioning and cleaning up the build environment.
