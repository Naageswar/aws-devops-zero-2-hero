### 1. What is AWS CodeDeploy?
AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a variety of compute platforms, including Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda functions, and on-premises servers.

### 2. How does CodeDeploy work?
CodeDeploy coordinates application deployments by pushing code changes to instances, managing deployment lifecycle events, and rolling back deployments if necessary.

### 3. What are the deployment strategies supported by CodeDeploy?
CodeDeploy supports various deployment strategies, including Blue-Green, In-Place, and Canary. Each strategy determines how new code versions are rolled out to instances.

### 4. Explain the Blue-Green deployment strategy in CodeDeploy.
In Blue-Green deployment, two identical environments (blue and green) are set up. New code is deployed to the green environment, and after successful testing, traffic is switched from the blue to the green environment.

### 5. How does CodeDeploy handle rollbacks?
If a deployment fails or triggers alarms, CodeDeploy can automatically roll back to the previous version of the application, minimizing downtime and impact.

### 6. Can you use CodeDeploy for serverless deployments?
Yes, CodeDeploy can be used to deploy AWS Lambda functions. It facilitates smooth updates to Lambda function code without service interruption.

### 7. What is an Application Revision in CodeDeploy?
An Application Revision is a version of your application code that is deployed using CodeDeploy. It can include application files, configuration files, and scripts necessary for deployment.

### 8. How can you integrate CodeDeploy with your CI/CD pipeline?
CodeDeploy can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline using services like AWS CodePipeline. After successful builds, the pipeline triggers CodeDeploy to deploy the new version.

### 9. What is a Deployment Group in CodeDeploy?
A Deployment Group is a set of instances or Lambda functions targeted for deployment. It defines where the application should be deployed and how the deployment should be executed.

### 10. How can you ensure zero downtime during application deployments?
Zero downtime can be achieved by using strategies like Blue-Green deployments or Canary deployments. These strategies allow you to gradually shift traffic to the new version while testing its stability.

### 11. Explain how you can manage deployment configuration in CodeDeploy.
Deployment configuration specifies parameters such as deployment style, traffic routing, and the order of deployment lifecycle events. It allows you to fine-tune deployment behavior.

### 12. How can you handle database schema changes during deployments?
Database schema changes can be managed using pre- and post-deployment scripts. These scripts ensure that the database is properly updated before and after deployment.

### 13. Describe a scenario where you would use the Canary deployment strategy.
You might use the Canary strategy when you want to gradually expose a new version to a small portion of your users for testing before rolling it out to the entire user base.

### 14. How does CodeDeploy handle instances with different capacities?
CodeDeploy can automatically distribute the new version of the application across instances with varying capacities by taking into account the deployment configuration and specified traffic weights.

### 15. What are hooks in CodeDeploy?
Hooks are scripts that run at various points in the deployment lifecycle. They allow you to perform custom actions, such as validating deployments or running tests, at specific stages.

### 16. How does CodeDeploy ensure consistent deployments across instances?
CodeDeploy uses an agent on each instance that manages deployment lifecycle events and ensures consistent application deployments.

### 17. What is the difference between an EC2/On-Premises deployment and a Lambda deployment in CodeDeploy?
An EC2/On-Premises deployment involves deploying code to instances, while a Lambda deployment deploys code to Lambda functions. Both utilize CodeDeploy's deployment capabilities.

### 18. How can you monitor the progress of a deployment in CodeDeploy?
You can monitor deployments using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. CodeDeploy provides detailed logs and metrics to track the status and progress of deployments.

### 19. Can CodeDeploy deploy applications across multiple regions?
Yes, CodeDeploy can deploy applications to multiple regions. However, each region requires its own deployment configuration and setup.

### 20. What is the role of the CodeDeploy agent?
The CodeDeploy agent is responsible for executing deployment instructions on instances. It communicates with the CodeDeploy service and manages deployment lifecycle events.
