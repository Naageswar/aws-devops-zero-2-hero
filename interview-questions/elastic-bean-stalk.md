### 1. What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that simplifies application deployment and management. It handles infrastructure provisioning, deployment, monitoring, and scaling, allowing developers to focus on writing code.

### 2. How does Elastic Beanstalk work?
Elastic Beanstalk abstracts the infrastructure layer, allowing you to upload your code (web application or microservices) and configuration. It then automatically deploys, manages, and scales your application based on the platform, language, and environment settings you choose.

### 3. What languages and platforms does Elastic Beanstalk support?
Elastic Beanstalk supports multiple programming languages and platforms, including Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker.

### 4. What is an Elastic Beanstalk environment?
An Elastic Beanstalk environment is a specific instance of your application that includes the runtime, resources, and configuration settings. You can have multiple environments (e.g., development, testing, production) for the same application.

### 5. How does Elastic Beanstalk handle updates and deployments?
Elastic Beanstalk supports both All at Once and Rolling deployments. All at Once deploys updates to all instances simultaneously, while Rolling deploys updates in batches to reduce downtime.

### 6. Can you customize the infrastructure in Elastic Beanstalk?
Yes, Elastic Beanstalk allows you to customize the environment's resources, configuration, and scaling settings through environment configuration files or the AWS Management Console.

### 7. How can you monitor the health of an Elastic Beanstalk environment?
Elastic Beanstalk provides health monitoring through CloudWatch. You can set up alarms based on metrics like CPU utilization, latency, and request count.

### 8. What is the Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI)?
The EB CLI is a command-line tool that provides an interface for interacting with Elastic Beanstalk. It enables developers to manage applications and environments using commands.

### 9. How does Elastic Beanstalk handle automatic scaling?
Elastic Beanstalk can automatically scale your application based on the configured scaling triggers, such as CPU utilization, network traffic, or other custom metrics.

### 10. Explain the difference between Single Instance and Load Balanced environments in Elastic Beanstalk.
In a Single Instance environment, your application runs on a single EC2 instance. In a Load Balanced environment, your application runs on multiple instances behind a load balancer, improving availability and scalability.

### 11. How does Elastic Beanstalk support rolling back deployments?
Elastic Beanstalk supports rolling back to a previous version if an update results in errors or issues. You can initiate a rollback through the AWS Management Console or the EB CLI.

### 12. Can Elastic Beanstalk deploy applications to multiple availability zones?
Yes, Elastic Beanstalk can automatically deploy your application to multiple availability zones within a region to enhance high availability.

### 13. How can you handle environment-specific configurations in Elastic Beanstalk?
You can use configuration files, environment variables, or Parameter Store to manage environment-specific configurations, ensuring your application behaves consistently across environments.

### 14. Describe how you would configure environment variables in Elastic Beanstalk.
Environment variables can be configured using the AWS Management Console, the EB CLI, or Elastic Beanstalk configuration files. They provide a way to pass dynamic values to your application.

### 15. Can Elastic Beanstalk deploy applications stored in containers?
Yes, Elastic Beanstalk supports deploying Docker containers. You can specify a Docker image repository and Elastic Beanstalk will handle deployment and management of the containerized application.

### 16. How can you automate deployments to Elastic Beanstalk?
You can use the AWS CodePipeline service to automate the deployment process to Elastic Beanstalk. This helps create a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

### 17. What is the difference between an environment URL and a CNAME in Elastic Beanstalk?
An environment URL is a unique URL automatically generated for each Elastic Beanstalk environment. A CNAME (Canonical Name) is an alias that you can configure to map a custom domain to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

### 18. Can Elastic Beanstalk be used for serverless applications?
While Elastic Beanstalk handles infrastructure provisioning, it is not a serverless service like AWS Lambda. It's designed to manage and scale applications on virtual machines.

### 19. What are worker environments in Elastic Beanstalk?
Worker environments in Elastic Beanstalk are used for background tasks and processing. They handle tasks asynchronously, separate from the main application environment.

### 20. How can you back up and restore an Elastic Beanstalk environment?
Elastic Beanstalk does not provide built-in backup and restore capabilities. However, you can use AWS services like Amazon RDS for database backups and CloudFormation for environment configuration versioning.
