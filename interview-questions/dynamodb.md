### 1. What is Amazon DynamoDB?
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It's designed to handle massive amounts of structured data across various use cases.

### 2. How does Amazon DynamoDB work?
DynamoDB stores data in tables, each with a primary key and optional secondary indexes. It automatically replicates data across multiple Availability Zones for high availability and durability.

### 3. What types of data models does Amazon DynamoDB support?
DynamoDB supports both document data model (key-value pairs) and columnar data model (tables with items and attributes). It's well-suited for a variety of applications, from simple key-value stores to complex data models.

### 4. What are the key features of Amazon DynamoDB?
Key features of DynamoDB include automatic scaling, multi-master replication, global tables for global distribution, support for ACID transactions, and seamless integration with AWS services.

### 5. What is the primary key in Amazon DynamoDB?
The primary key is used to uniquely identify items within a table. It consists of a partition key (and optional sort key), which determines how data is distributed and stored.

### 6. How does partitioning work in Amazon DynamoDB?
DynamoDB divides a table's data into partitions based on the partition key. Each partition can store up to 10 GB of data and handle a certain amount of read and write capacity.

### 7. What is the difference between a partition key and a sort key in DynamoDB?
The partition key is used to distribute data across partitions, while the sort key is used to determine the order of items within a partition. Together, they create a unique identifier for each item.

### 8. How can you query data in Amazon DynamoDB?
You can use the Query operation to retrieve items from a table based on the primary key or a secondary index. Queries are efficient and support various filter expressions.

### 9. What are secondary indexes in Amazon DynamoDB?
Secondary indexes allow you to query the data using attributes other than the primary key. Global secondary indexes span the entire table, while local secondary indexes are created on a specific partition.

### 10. What is eventual consistency in DynamoDB?
DynamoDB offers both strong consistency and eventual consistency for read operations. With eventual consistency, changes made to items may take some time to propagate across all replicas.

### 11. How can you ensure data durability in Amazon DynamoDB?
DynamoDB replicates data across multiple Availability Zones, ensuring data durability and availability even in the event of hardware failures or AZ outages.

### 12. Can you change the schema of an existing Amazon DynamoDB table?
Yes, you can change the schema of an existing DynamoDB table by modifying the provisioned throughput, changing the primary key, adding or removing secondary indexes, and more.

### 13. What is the capacity mode in Amazon DynamoDB?
DynamoDB offers two capacity modes: Provisioned and On-Demand. In Provisioned mode, you provision a specific amount of read and write capacity. In On-Demand mode, capacity is automatically adjusted based on usage.

### 14. How can you automate the scaling of Amazon DynamoDB tables?
You can enable auto scaling for your DynamoDB tables to automatically adjust read and write capacity based on traffic patterns. Auto scaling helps maintain optimal performance.

### 15. What is DynamoDB Streams?
DynamoDB Streams captures changes to items in a table, allowing you to process and react to those changes in real time. It's often used for building event-driven applications.

### 16. How can you back up Amazon DynamoDB tables?
DynamoDB provides backup and restore capabilities. You can create on-demand backups or enable continuous backups, which automatically create backups as data changes.

### 17. What is the purpose of the DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)?
DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is an in-memory cache that provides high-speed access to frequently accessed items. It reduces the need to read data from the main DynamoDB table.

### 18. How can you implement transactions in Amazon DynamoDB?
DynamoDB supports ACID transactions for multiple item updates. You can use the `TransactWriteItems` operation to group multiple updates into a single, atomic transaction.

### 19. What is the difference between Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon S3?
Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service optimized for high-performance, low-latency applications with structured data. Amazon S3 is an object storage service used for storing files, images, videos, and more.

### 20. What are Global Tables in Amazon DynamoDB?
Global Tables enable you to replicate data across multiple AWS regions, providing low-latency access to DynamoDB data from users around the world.
